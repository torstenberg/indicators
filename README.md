# Indicators
All about indicators and assessment systems ...

This could evolve into a place where I document knowledge, advice and links for everyone interested in indicator development in the field of marine waters and marine ecosystems and ecology. Let's see how ths will work out!

For now, there is only a list of references I used in my presentationat a workshop.

## Literature references from the ENA workshop in List/Sylt, 25-27 Sept 2017
