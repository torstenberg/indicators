# Indicators
All about indicators and assessment systems ...

This could evolve into a place where I document knowledge, advice and links for everyone interested in indicator development in the field of marine waters and marine ecosystems and ecology. Let's see how this will work out! I have started to write an expanded abstract of the presentation which will slowly evolve into at least an article-lenth text (even a book-like ... who knows). Read my initial text here:

[**PDF of expanded abstract/initial article**](https://github.com/torstenberg/indicators/blob/master/article/IndicatorsAndAssessment.pdf)

([markdown source file for the article](https://github.com/torstenberg/indicators/blob/master/article/IndicatorsAndAssessment.md))

Feel free to comment on this either by mail or using the github 'issues' in the toolbar above (will be quite nerdy for the coding-unaware, but worth a try :-)

For now, there is also the [presentation file itself](https://github.com/torstenberg/indicators/blob/master/indicators-assessment-presentation.pdf), the [abstract](https://github.com/torstenberg/indicators/blob/master/presentation-abstract.md) and a list of references I used in my presentation at the workshop (see below).

You may want to visit my page on [researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Torsten_Berg) where you can find more papers and references.
